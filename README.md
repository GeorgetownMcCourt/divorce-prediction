# Project Name: divorce-prediction
## Predicting American Divorce
___

### Overview/Synopsis

The goal of this project is to find a model that accurately predicts if a person is divorced (among other outcomes, single, married, widowed, etc). We think that there are a series of social, economic, racial, religious and geographic variables that relate to a certain person being divorced.


### Use
TODO: Specific example of what happens in your project (e.g. what's going on under the hood)

We are ceating a tool that accurate predicts if your are divorced or not.

We use two different models: Decision trees and Random Forest to predict...


### Data Used

We use the Current Population Survey (http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/cps_ftp.html). We downloaded the data using a parsing script written within DOC and given by Prof Jeff Chen for public use. We modified it to get the data for the twelve months of 2016.

We have approximately 1.8 million observations and 389 variables.

The parsing script also creates a dictonary for these variables.

### Usage
TODO: Write usage instructions 
Note: If you're providing a new package or software, provide examples of how to use your code (example: https://github.com/CommerceDataService/eu.us.opendata). If you're providing an analytical output, describe what goes on each file or how to run it.
