# Project Name: divorce-prediction
## Predicting American Divorce
___

### Overview/Synopsis

The goal of this project is to find a model that accurately predicts if a person is divorced (among other outcomes, single, married, widowed, etc). We think that there are a series of social, economic, racial, religious and geographic variables that relate to a certain person being divorced.
